# first_website
This is my first time making a website, I used PHP, CSS, and Javascript.

To run the program. 
Open XAMPP and start.
Add all the files to the XAMP extension : lampp > htdocs  
Go to web browser and enter localhost/home.php or localhost:8080/home.php in URL bar.
Once you get there, all other pages are connected to that page.
